In this Assingment:
In this assingment, I have take a bank's telemarketing business problem to understand the types of customers which should be targeted for future marketing campaigns. The dataset contains demographic and personal information of about 45000 people and their response to a telemarketing campaign, i.e. whether they bought a certain product when contacted by the company through telemarketing. 

 

Our objective is to find the attributes of customers who are likely to buy the product when contacted through telemarketing. This is a classic case of acquisition analytics where companies use past data to predict which customers are likely to buy certain products.
